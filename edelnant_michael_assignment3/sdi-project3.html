		This is a short story about a particular eight ball match I had during my APA league play. To set the scene, we were playing at Trickshots, Winter Park against the 2nd place team. We are currently in 1st and want to hold our lead since weâ€™re approaching the middle of the season.

			<li>APA stands for "American Pool Players Association"</li>
			<li>Each team consist of 8 total players.</li>
			<li>Only 5 players from each team can play within one evening.</li>
			<li>Skill levels(handicaps) exist to even out the playing field.</li>
			<li>There is a total SL cap per team match. No team can exceed 23 when all SL's played are combined.</li>
			<li>I am an SL6</li>
			<li>The highest SL for 8 ball in the APA system is 7.</li>
